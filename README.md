Virtual Museum
==============

Virtual tour of Victoria and Albert Museum the world's leading museum of art and design.


The Idea
========
This project was an entry to the hack.summit() 2016 hackathon, we decided to address the "data visualizations" theme. We were both very keen to
explore how we could create a virtual tour of unseen museum artefacts. After researching, we found that the Victoria and Albert Museum in London provided a great
api for us to collect images and information about vault stored artefacts.

In essence, our web application allows you to search artefacts stored in the museum and view the images and details about each artefact in ThreeJS.
The reason that we made this is because there are over 2,000 artefacts accessible by the API for the V&A museum alone. Our project provides people with
an interactive and quick way to search these iconic, and often unseen pieces of art.

We would like to continue with our project by:
 - Creating an interesting interior for the artefacts to be viewed in.
 - Support the extended functionality of the API to retrieve descriptions and creators comments about the pieces.
 - Develop the project as a learning tool for students anywhere around the world to teach them about the interesting artefacts in museums across the world.

This was our first time using ThreeJS so there was an evident steep learning curve involved during the 48 hours!
However, we hope that this project inspires someone to create something interesting with our idea.
